**INTRODUCTION**

This application is used to help users understand what DOM (Document Object Model) and Event Listener is and How to
manipulate them.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

In this application, I import the third party API to generate the random date to use, which is
named [Faker](https://fakerjs.dev/). Such a package of JavaScript is quite useful and helpful.

1. Install it with the
   following command `npm install @faker-js/faker --save-dev` via the [website](https://fakerjs.dev/guide/).
2. Find it in your root folder `node_modules/@faker-js/faker`.
3. Import it with the following command `const {faker} = await import('https://esm.sh/@faker-js/faker')` or `;
import {faker} from 'https://esm.sh/@faker-js/faker'`. Besides, you can find the usage of Faker in
   the [website](https://fakerjs.dev/guide/usage.html).
4. ~~There could be two files named `package-lock.json`in the root folder and node_modules. You can delete the one in
   the
   node_modules with the following command `rm -f node_modules/.package-lock.json`.~~
